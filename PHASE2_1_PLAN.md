# 🗄️ PHASE 2.1 DEVELOPMENT PLAN - OSRS Database System

## 1. Overview

Phase 2.1 focuses on creating a comprehensive database system for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) containing all essential game data. This database will serve as the foundation for intelligent decision-making across all script functionalities including combat, banking, item management, and navigation.

## 2. Database Scope & Objectives

### 2.1 Equipment & Weapons Database

- **Armor sets** with defence level requirements and combat bonuses
- **Accessories** (rings, amulets, capes, gloves, boots) with requirements
- **Special weapons** with unique attack styles and special attacks
- **Degradable equipment** with repair costs and mechanics

### 2.2 NPC Database
- **Combat NPCs** with locations, combat levels, and weaknesses
- **Regional mapping** of NPCs to specific areas and coordinates
- **Drop tables** for loot optimization
- **Aggressive/non-aggressive** behavior patterns
- **Slayer monsters** with task requirements

### 2.3 Consumables Database
- **Food items** with healing amounts and requirements
- **Potions** with effects, durations, and level requirements
- **Prayer items** (bones, ashes) with experience values
- **Ammunition** (arrows, bolts, runes) with requirements

### 2.4 Banking & Location Database
- **Bank locations** with precise coordinates and access requirements
- **Deposit boxes** and alternative banking methods
- **Shops** for buying/selling items
- **Transportation hubs** (teleports, boats, etc.)

## 3. Technical Architecture
