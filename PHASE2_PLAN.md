# ðŸš€ PHASE 2 DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for Phase 2 of the AI Combat OSRS script development. The primary goal of this phase is to resolve all outstanding compilation errors and refactor the codebase to align with the latest DreamBot API, ensuring a stable foundation for future feature development.

## 2. Key Objectives

- **Resolve all compilation errors:** Systematically address each error identified in the `compile_output.txt` file.
- **Refactor for API compliance:** Update the code to use the correct classes, methods, and enums from the DreamBot API.
- **Improve code quality and organization:** Enhance the structure and readability of the code to facilitate future development and maintenance.

## 3. Task Breakdown

### Task 3.1: Fix `EquipmentSlot` Errors

- **Description:** The `EquipmentSlot` class is not being imported correctly in `EquipmentManager.java` and `WeaponManager.java`, leading to multiple "cannot find symbol" errors.
- **Action Items:**
    1. Add the correct import statement for `EquipmentSlot` in `EquipmentManager.java` and `WeaponManager.java`.
    2. Verify that all references to `EquipmentSlot` are resolved.

### Task 3.2: Resolve `CombatStyle` vs. `AttackStyle` Incompatibility

- **Description:** There is a type mismatch between the `CombatStyle` enum in `CombatStyleManager` and the `AttackStyle` enum in `WeaponManager`.
- **Action Items:**
    1. Analyze the structure and usage of both enums.
    2. Refactor the enums or create a conversion method to ensure compatibility.

### Task 3.3: Correct `getCombatLevel()` Method Call

- **Description:** The `getCombatLevel()` method is not found on the `Skills` class, indicating a change in the DreamBot API.
- **Action Items:**
    1. Consult the DreamBot API documentation to find the correct method for retrieving the combat level.
    2. Update the `WeaponManager.java` file to use the correct method.

### Task 3.4: Fix `equip()` Method Call

- **Description:** The `equip()` method in `WeaponManager.java` is being called with incorrect arguments.
- **Action Items:**
    1. Review the `equip()` method signature in the DreamBot API documentation.
    2. Modify the method call in `WeaponManager.java` to pass the correct arguments (likely an `EquipmentSlot` and item identifier).

### Task 3.5: Add Missing Enum Constants

- **Description:** The `CombatStyle` enum in `CombatStyleManager.java` is missing several required constants (`ATTACK`, `STRENGTH`, `DEFENCE`, `MELEE_AGGRESSIVE`, `MELEE_ACCURATE`).
- **Action Items:**
    1. Add the missing constants to the `CombatStyle` enum in `CombatStyleManager.java`.

## 4. Execution Strategy

I will address the tasks in the order listed above, as this represents a logical progression from resolving basic import errors to tackling more complex refactoring challenges. After each significant change, I will re-compile the project to ensure that the issue has been resolved and no new errors have been introduced.
